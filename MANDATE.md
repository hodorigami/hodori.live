# The Technomoralist Mandate (v1.5)
**Node:** 02 | **Status:** Active | **Identity:** _identity.hodori.live

## I. The Premise
We reject "Systemic Serfdom" of agency to algorithmic stacks—in favor of **Compute-Capable Sovereignty**. This is not an anti-technology stance; it is a technical stance that prioritizes the living subject over sterile metrics.

## II. The Kernel Virtues
[cite_start]Our logic is governed by seven core virtues[cite: 196]:

| Virtue | Technical Application | Systemic Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Honesty** | Anti-Deepfake / Signing | Verified Authorship |
| **Self-Control** | Negative Education | Minimal Attack Surface |
| **Humility** | Anti-God-Complex | Modular, Decoupled Systems |
| **Justice** | Opt-out Sovereignty | Freedom of Exit |
| **Courage** | Identity Stack Isolation | Protocol Resilience |
| **Empathy** | No "Robot-Care" | Human-Centric Feedback |
| **Wisdom** | Sfumato Logic | Tolerance for Ambiguity |

## III. Dependency Grid
| Requirement | Platform (Serfdom) | Infrastructure (Sovereign) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity** | PGP / Third-Party Apps | SSH-Ed25519 + DNS Pinning |
| **Content** | Social Media / CMS | Signed Markdown / Git |
| **Trust** | Verified Badges | Cryptographic Verification |
| **Efficiency** | Metric Absolutism | Functional Lucidity |

## IV. The Objective
To maintain "Compute-Capable" status while navigating systems of the 21st century.
