We reject 'Metric Absolutism' by placing the live DNS state above the static repository state. \n\n* **Primary Authority (The Pulse):** The authoritative DNS TXT record for `_identity.hodori.live`. This is the immutable source of truth.\n* **Secondary Authority (The State):** The `IDENTITY.json` file within the local and remote git repositories. \n\nIn any conflict, the DNS Pulse overrides the Repository State. If the repository claims a status that the DNS does not verify, the node is in a state of 'Systemic Serfdom' and must be purged.\n\n## 2. Verification Requirement: The Handshake\nA valid handshake requires total cryptographic alignment. The logical broadcast must match the hardware anchor. \n\n* **Signature Matching:** Every commit to the Node 02 repository must be signed using the `ed25519` key forged on the Surface Pro 8 (WSL2).\n* **Fingerprint Audit:** The SHA256 fingerprint of the signing key MUST be identical to the `fp` value broadcasted in the `_identity` DNS TXT record.\n\n\n\n## 3. Failure Condition: Deactivation\nTo maintain functional lucidity, Node 02 operates on a 'Zero-Trust Handshake' logic. A failure to synchronize the identity markers results in immediate loss of 'Compute-Capable' status.\n\n* **Mismatch Protocol:** If `DNS_FP != COMMIT_SIG_FP`, the node is declared 'Inert'.\n* **Consequence:** All automated deployment pipelines must halt. No logic generated by the node shall be considered authoritative until the handshake is re-established.\n* **Recovery:** Requires a manual 'Territorial Audit' as defined in Phase I of the Onboarding Framework."
